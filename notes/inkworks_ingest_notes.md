inkwork ingest types
====================

These are the different types and thus will probably have to be brought in separately:

objects:
	- title
	- description
	- date
	- size

entities *should these be added first?*:
	- photographer
	- designer
	- client
	- source artist
	- creator=inkworks

representations:
	- filename

lots **just create one and refer to it per object**

storage locations **can also just refer to?**

places **again, just refer if can assume a single value?**
