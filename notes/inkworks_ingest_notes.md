inkwork ingest types
====================

These are the different types and thus will probably have to be brought in separately:

item (typeid=):
	* title
	* description
	* date
	* size

entities (typeid=) *should these be added first?*:
	* photographer 
	* designer
	* client
	* source artist(?)
	* creator='inkworks'

representations (typeid=463?):
	- filename

lots (typeid=) **just create one and refer to it per object**

storage locations (typeid=) **can also just refer to?**
